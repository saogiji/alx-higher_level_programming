# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects
## Introduction
Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object oriented programming.
object oriented programming is a way of organizing a program which combines data and functionality and wrap it inside something called an object.
A class creates a new type where objects are instances of the class.
