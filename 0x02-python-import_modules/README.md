# 0x02. Python - import & modules
## Introduction
When running python programs, we need to use datasets for data analysis. Python has various modules which help us in importing the external data in various file formats to a python program.
To use any package in your code, you must first make it accessible. You have to import it. You can't use anything in Python before it is defined. Some things are built in, for example the basic types (like int, float, etc) can be used whenever you want. But most things you will want to do will need a little more than that thus the concept of importing.
This project illustrates how to import data of various formats to a python program.
## Projects/Tasks

A program that imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3.
### 1. My first toolbox!
A  program that imports functions from the file calculator_1.py, does some Maths, and prints the result.
### 2. How to make a script dynamic!
A program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments.
### 3. Infinite addition
A program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments.
