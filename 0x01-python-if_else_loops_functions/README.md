# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions
## Introduction
### if/else
If statements are control flow statements which helps us to run a particular code only when a certain condition is satisfied.
It is used when we need to execute a certain block of Python code when a particular condition is true.
The syntax of if statement in python is given as:
`if condition:
   block_of_code
OR 
if test expression:
    statement(s)`
### loops
A loop statement is used to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times.

Python programming language provides three basic types of loops to handle looping requirements.
#### 1. while loop
Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is TRUE. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
#### 2. for loop
Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
#### 3. nested loops
You can use one or more loop inside any another while, for or do..while loop.
