# 0x05. Python - Exceptions
## Introduction
Tere re two types of errors: syntax errors and exceptions.
### Syntax Errors
A syntax error is an error in the syntax of a sequence of characters or tokens that is intended to be written in compile-time. A program will not compile until all syntax errors are corrected.
### Exceptions
A An exception (or exceptional event) is a problem that arises during the execution of a program. When an Exceptionoccurs the normal flow of the program is disrupted and the program/Application terminates abnormally, which is not recommended, therefore, these exceptions are to be handled.
### Differences between Syntax Error and Exception.
Both errors and exceptions are unwanted occurrence during the execution of a program. However, they have key differences. 
1. Exceptions can be foreseen by the programmer, while an error is difficult to foresee.
2. Exceptions can be checked or unchecked. But errors are always unchecked.
